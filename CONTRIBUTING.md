## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by reaching out to me personally [via e-mail](https://www.kilala.nl/index.php?id=777).


## What should I know before I get started?

To run KilalaCMS you will need PHP and you'll need to download a few modules for both PHP and Javascript. Refer to the build instructions in README.md.

This Git repository has a pre-configured Gitleaks pre-commit hook. If you don't have Gitleaks setup via Docker, any commits you try will get blocked.


## How Can I Contribute?

### Submitting improvements

Right now, kilalaCMS is a labor-of-love for my personal blog. I'm not looking to make it a true open source project with multiple contributors.
